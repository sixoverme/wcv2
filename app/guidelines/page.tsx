            <p>
              We believe in the power of mutual aidâ€”giving what we can and receiving what we need. There is no
              expectation of direct exchange, but rather a culture of generosity that strengthens our collective
              resilience.

            <p>
              We honor the dignity of every community member. We recognize that each person brings valuable knowledge,
              skills, and experiences. We listen deeply and speak with care.

            <p>
              We are accountable to each other and to the community as a whole. We acknowledge when harm occurs, take
              responsibility for our actions, and work together to repair relationships.
            </p>

              We actively work to make our community accessible to all, recognizing that systems of oppression create
              barriers to participation. We center the voices and needs of those most impacted by injustice.

          <p>
            Woven Circles uses a community-based moderation approach. When content is reported, it is reviewed by a
            rotating group of community moderators who have been trained in our values and agreements.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our goal is always to address harm, repair relationships, and maintain a safe and supportive community
            space. We approach moderation with compassion and a commitment to growth rather than punishment.
          </p>

          <p>
            In cases where content clearly violates our community agreements or poses a risk to community members, it
            may be removed. The person who posted it will be contacted privately to discuss the issue and find a path
            forward.
          </p>

          <p>
            Repeated or severe violations may result in temporary or permanent removal from the platform, but this is
            always a last resort after attempts at dialogue and repair.
